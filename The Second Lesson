Hello, and today, we are going to learn HTML!
HTML stands for hypertext markup language
and the most common header is this:

<h1>

You can go crazy with it! Check This out!

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, People!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

That is a basic header for a website, you can change the name where it says <title>, and <h1>

In the end, all of that coding only says Hello, People! Coding is a very laborious job. 

How To Make Text Smaller with HTML:
This is pretty easy:

<h1 style="font-size:1em ;"> HellO! </h1>

Again with the header <h1> and you should always end it with </h1>.
Here's a little example:

<h1>Why am I still here *sigh* </h1>
And thats it for this lesson!
