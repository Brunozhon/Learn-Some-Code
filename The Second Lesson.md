Hello, and today, we are going to learn HTML!
HTML stands for hypertext markup language
and the most common header is this:

<h1>

You can go crazy with it! Check This out!

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, People!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
That is a basic header for a website, you can change the name where it says <title>, and <h1>

In the end, all of that coding only says Hello, People! Coding is a very laborious job. 

How To Make Text Smaller with HTML:
This is pretty easy:
```
<h1 style="font-size:1em ;"> HellO! </h1>
```

Again with the header <h1> and you should always end it with </h1>.
Here's a little example:
```
<h1>Why am I still here *sigh* </h1>
```

There is also <div> </div> <p> </p> and that are all the headers

Here's how to make colored text using HTML!
```
<h2><span style="color:#FF0000">H</span><span style="color:#FF4600">e</span><span style="color:#FF8B00">r</span><span style="color:#FFD100">e</span><span style="color:#E8FF00">'</span><span style="color:#A2FF00">s</span> <span style="color:#5DFF00">a</span> <span style="color:#17FF00">s</span><span style="color:#00FF2E">u</span><span style="color:#00FF74">r</span><span style="color:#00FFB9">p</span><span style="color:#00FFFF">r</span><span style="color:#00B9FF">i</span><span style="color:#0074FF">s</span><span style="color:#002EFF">e</span> <span style="color:#1700FF">f</span><span style="color:#5D00FF">o</span><span style="color:#A200FF">r</span> <span style="color:#E800FF">y</span><span style="color:#FF00D1">o</span><span style="color:#FF008B">u</span><span style="color:#FF0046">!</span></h2>
```
